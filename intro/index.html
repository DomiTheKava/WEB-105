        <h2>Hobby's</h2>

            <h3>Hockey</h3>
                <p>Hockey is super exciting because it's really fast and needs players to work together. Imagine zooming on the ice, making quick choices, and passing the puck – that's hockey! </p>

            <h3>Coding</h3>
                <p>Coding is like having a superpower for creating things on the computer. It's awesome because you can use your imagination to build cool stuff and solve problems. With coding, you can make your own games, websites, and even helpful apps that people use. It's like a fun adventure that never ends, where you learn new things and make really neat stuff!</p>

            <h3>Why I am taking this class</h2>
                <p>Ever since I was a child, I’ve always loved any form of coding. There is something about seeing text transform into something that I can visualize and interact with that I just love. With that in mind, my goal is to learn how become a Web Developer or Web Designer and pursue it as a career. :-]</p>
